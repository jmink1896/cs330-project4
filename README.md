## Motivation
During weight training, it is often desired to film yourself during a lifting set, as observing your form while lifting is one of the best ways to identify problems with your lifting form and to improve it. 
When filming, you often prepare equipment such as a tripod to place your cell phone at a fixed position, then record your sets.
However, recording with a standard camera application implies a usability issue, as the user has to
1. Approach the cell phone,
2. Press the ‘start recording’ button,
3. Go to the rack and perform the set,
4. Go back to the cell-phone,
5. Press the ‘stop recording’ button

For every set one would like to record. If a man, for instance, wishes to record 5 sets of squats, he has to go back and forth between the squat rack and his cell phone 5 times. This movement is unnecessary if we could automate the recording of each set.


## Goal of the Application
Assisquat is our sensor-based application to automatically record the user’s exercise sets. 
The app uses continuous sensor monitoring and ML models to remotely detect the start and end of each set to record the sets.
